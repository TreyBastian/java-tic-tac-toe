# java-tic-tac-toe
This is a fork of command line implementation of the game tic tac toe in Java originally written by [Taha Zoabi](https://github.com/TahaZoabi)

## Purpose
On May 22nd 2024 I live streamed a code review and refactoring session with this codebase on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/trey_bastian)

The live stream VOD can be found here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2152119743

We introduced some better Java practices while still staying somewhat true to the orignial codebase and it's intent.

We didn't want to introduce too advanced of concepts in the process of making these changes. There are likely better ways to build this game. I can think of a few more changes I'd make myself, but that wasn't the point of this.

## License
The original repostiroy did not have a license so this one does not either. It's source available but [Taha Zoabi](https://github.com/TahaZoabi) remains the owner of this codebase.
We did this work with permission from the original code owner.
